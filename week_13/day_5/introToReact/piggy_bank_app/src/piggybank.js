The deposit method is being passed as a callback to the button, therefore inside deposit, <this> isnâ€™t the PiggyBank class. We want it to be the PiggyBank class, so that it can access the state.
                // The way React suggest to solve this problem is to the bind method. bind is a function method (in JavaScript, functions are first class objects and therefore can have methods stored on them). It allows us to call it on a function and pass in whatever context we want it to have. It returns a new function with the specified context. React suggests to create this new version of the function as a property of the class.
