//SOLID
//s - single responsibility principle (a function should be responsible for one actio)
//o - open/close principle (you code should be open to be added to but closed for modification)
//l - liskov substitution principle ()
//i - interface segregation principle (interfaces should be segragated)
//d - dependency inversion principle ()

//4 Pillars
//abstraction -
//encapsulation -
//polymorphism -
//inheritence -
